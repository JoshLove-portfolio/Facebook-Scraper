# Facebook-Scraper
This script takes downloaded Facebook information and extras data about post quantities over time. This is my first script. 

This bot will not work without editting the code to meet your personal conditions.

Inspiration for this bot comes from the book Mining Social Media, Finding Stories In Internet Data by Lam Thuy Yo.

HOW TO USE:

DOWNLOADING FACEBOOK DATA -
  1. NAVIGATE TO YOUR FACEBOOK PROFILE AND SELECT SETTINGS -> YOUR FACEBOOK INFORMATION -> DOWNLOAD YOUR INFORMATION
  2. WAIT FOR THE DATA TO EITHER ARRIVE IN YOUR INBOX OR THE NOTIFACTION ON FACEBOOK
  3. SAVE THE ASSOCIATED ZIP FILE INTO A FOLDER, I SAVED MINE INTO "FACEBOOK-NAME" IN MY DOCUMENTS
  4. EXTRACT THE CONTENTS OF THE ZIP INTO THAT FOLDER
  5. PLACE THE CODE "FACEBOOK-SCRAPER.PY" INTO THE SAME FOLDER AS THE DATA
  
EDITTING THE CODE FOR PERSONAL USE - 
  1. OPEN THE CODE AND EDIT THE FOLLOWING FIELDS:
    A. VARIABLE foldername (EDIT TO REFLECT THE NAME OF THE FOLDER YOU SAVED THE ZIP INTO)
    B. THE OPEN STATEMENT TO REFLECT THE PATH TO THE FOLDER
    
EITHER RUN THE FILE IN A IDE OR THROUGH CMD
